Sleep is essential for physical and mental well-being.
Getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night helps the body recover and repair itself.

Good sleep improves concentration, memory, and learning ability.
Lack of sleep can lead to reduced productivity, irritability, and weakened immunity.

Maintaining a regular sleep schedule and reducing screen time before bed can improve sleep quality.
A calm and dark sleeping environment also supports better rest.

Adequate sleep plays an important role in stress management and overall health.
