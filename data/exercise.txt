Regular physical activity is important for maintaining good health.
Exercise helps improve heart health, strengthen muscles, and increase stamina.

Walking is one of the simplest and most effective forms of exercise.
Regular walking improves blood circulation, reduces stress, and helps control body weight.

Exercise also plays a role in mental health.
Physical activity releases endorphins, which help reduce anxiety and improve mood.

Adults are generally encouraged to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.
