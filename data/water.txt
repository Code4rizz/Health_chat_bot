Water is essential for human survival and overall health.
Drinking enough water helps maintain body temperature, lubricate joints, and aid digestion.

Most adults are generally advised to drink around 2 to 3 liters of water per day.
However, water requirements vary depending on age, physical activity, climate, and health conditions.

Drinking water regularly helps prevent dehydration, which can cause fatigue, headaches, and poor concentration.
People who exercise frequently or live in hot climates may need more water.

Clear or pale yellow urine is often a sign of proper hydration.
